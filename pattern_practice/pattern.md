# Pattern printing
Printing the pattern given on TUF website. These are mainly to strengthen loop concepts, but are essential overall.

# Best way to solve pattern printing problems is follow the steps

1. outer loop is for rows 
2. inner loop is for columns, focus on columns and connect them through logic to the rows.
3. print them inside the inner for loop.
4. observe symmetry in case of some patterns.

# Python specific changes
In the print statements for python by default always in "\n" character. So the line character to be different we need to specify end parameter to be empty string.
